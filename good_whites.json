This wine is fresh, fruity, with amazing body, mineral, with strong acidity and a long finish.",

        "56": "Very floral aromas, with notes of wild fennel, ripe peach, and a touch of tropical fruit (pineapple, mango). On the palate it shows its varietal characteristics: fresh, structured, and unmistakably Godello. The finish has a pronounced minerality and a slight pleasing bitterness.",
        "60": "Violet and hyacinth aromas make you think of Riesling (as these wines often do), but the palate is all apples and Rainier cherries with a chalk-powder sprinkle; wonderfully silky and generous, refined and accurate.",

        "139": "Bright and straw-coloured with golden hues. Its' nose is complex, intense and fruity; reminiscent of other grape varieties, with hints of pineapple and grapefruit, toast, butter and bakery. After 5 to 6 months of ageing in French Oak barrels, a fresh, citric, smoky, and slightly spiced flavor is achieved. It is a wine with body, just the right notes of wood, unctuous, with a long, fresh and delicate finish. It is a faithful reflection of our personality and has huge potential for laying down.",
        "175": "The color goes from pale straw yellow with green highlights to pale gold; fruit and citrusy aromas; fresh and full-bodied. Perfect for antipasti, and shellfish based dishes.  ",

        "239": "As usual, we have used methods so traditional as to be antique. The base wine is barrel fermented and aged. The primary and subsequent bottle fermentations are done very slowly. The wine is bottle-aged for five years before disgorging and receives a small (dosage) of sweetened wine to flesh out the texture.",
        "244": "At Acacia Vineyard our aim is to create a rich, concentrated and focused Chardonnay from our remarkable Carneros fruit. We hand harvested the fruit for our 2005 Carneros Chardonnay, then allowed three hours of skin contact to extract flavors from the skin. A brief period of aeration enabled us to extract those delicious flavors and precipitate out any tannins associated with skin contact. The result is a full-flavored Chardonnay with both concentration and elegance.  Vibrant aromas of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, ginger, lemon curd and white peach are followed by a creamy entry which blossoms to a full, sweet, peach, nectarine and citrus mid-palate. Medium-bodied with vibrant acidity, the wine finishes long and full. Our 2005 Chardonnay is perfect with all types of seafood, fish, chicken and pork. ",

In the mouth, a firm and fine line of acidity provides brightness to the fleshy mid palate, while a lingering minerality, reminiscent of the sea, extends the long finish.  A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sauvignon Musque and Semillon, the wine is refreshing, persistent, restrained and sophisticated. ",
        "342": "This lovely pale and golden straw colored Sauvignon Blanc begins with a bouquet of citrus blossoms, fresh tangerines, Bosc pear, and jasmine. On the palate, this medium-bodied wine continues with flavors of ripe white grapefruits, mandarin oranges, and caramelized Meyer lemon cream along with notes of pineapple rind, lemon verbena and wet slate. A clean acidity and pleasant texture frames the long and pure finish of this enjoyable and refreshing wine. ",
        "362": "\"Veigas\" are the verdant fields of Galicia. Selected grapes from two \"eidos\" of ungrafted vines over 80 years old are micro-vinified each year. Held on the fine lees until July following the vintage, a mouth-filling, complex and lingering Albari\u00f1o is the result.",
        "363": "Extraordinary quality. Elegant, intense, clean, full on the palate and clearly expressing the mountainside slate/chalk terroir. Unoaked and fresh,fruit/floral/mineral blended into a harmonious whole.  ",

An intense nose with elegant aromas and hints of fresh aromatic herbs and white flowers emerges, as well as nuances of white stone fruits, green apples, citrus and pear.

        "373": "Anna\u2019s white blend contrasts the crisp and aromatic accents of 4 of these, emphasizing the apple and citrus personality of Grenache Blanc. The goal here is balance, that pushpull between purity and richness, achieving a sustaining sense of flavor, the pleasure center.

        "397": "There are wonderful accented aromas of apple blossom, lemon zest, and wildflowers. These aromas follow through on the palate and are supported by a vibrant core of acidity, wrapped in layers of texture that adds depth and dimension to the wine. ",

The appellation benefits from a coastal influence and a cold climate, both favorable for making outstanding wines from Burgundian varieties. The vineyard is owned and farmed by Jim Pratt. Only four rows of clone 15 were planted and are farmed carefully for Cattleya, to produce the best clusters of Chardonnay grapes.

Fermentation and aging on the lees in neutral white barrels has added complexity, though blocking the malo-lactic keeps the primary fruit front and center. Some people have suggested Godello as an alternative to Chardonnay. ",

        "9589": "Semillon was planted on the Chalk Hill Estate in 1981, primarily to blend with Sauvignon blanc. The site, however, was chosen to take advantage of Semillons susceptibility to botrytis, or \"noble rot\". This block is planted to 80% Semillon and 20% Sauvignon blanc, as in Sauternes, and lies at the bottom of a north-facing slope, sheltered by the hills to the east and west. There is little morning or afternoon sun, and moisture burns off slowly late in the season. After the grapes are fully ripe, light rainfall encourages botrytis development. When this is followed by a period of warm, dry weather the fruit is dessicated, concentrating the acid and sugar. This rare combination of events occurred in 1994, and a small lot of Semillon and Sauvignon blanc was finally harvested in late October at nearly 40\u00b0 Brix. ",

If you want to stay more traditional, try it with dry goat cheese, or even some bleu, as the wine will balance with the saltiness of the cheese.",
        "9657": "This Carneros-designated Blanc de Noirs has a delicate copper color and fruit aromas of strawberry and cherry overlaid with warm cocoa from Pinot Noir. Its softer cousin Pinot Meunier contributes a warm spice, almost clove character with overtones of orange peel and freshly baked bread. To enhance this Cuvee 391, wines from the 1991 vintage were blended with selected vin de reserve held back from previous years. 1991 was characterized by cool conditions during maturation and harvest, critical to flavor development for sparkling wine.

A brininess and citrus zest keep this wine fresh and thirst quenching.",

        "9803": "The 2014 Rose is quite simply the most awesomely complex and complete Rose we've made to date. The winemaking hasn't changed a great deal over the years; so we attribute much of this complexity to the diversity of grape varieties and, even more, to the mix of vineyards that are increasingly on the very fringe of where these grapes can ripen. The color is similar to the 2013 with its vibrant pink, salmon and fuchsia edges. More than ever, the wild red fruit of strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry are interwoven with Herbs de Provence and grass, a touch of citrus and an even greater presence of minerality. It was generally a lower acid year, but you wouldn't know that from the natural acid in the wine and bright finish. To promote vibrant aromas, we used a few new experimental yeasts, which we liked a lot and, as ever, maintained lees contact to build up body until we blended for bottling. Syrah dominates the blend as it always has, but the co-star varieties play an increasingly important role.",

A delicate, distinctive bubble, the result of more than 15 years of aging in Gallo-Roman chalk cellars. The rich bouquet offers up aromas of dried and candied fruits such as hazelnuts, almonds and dates. The wine of aesthete, with deep handy notes of beeswax and nougat. The year 1995 finds expression in this wine thanks to the voluptuous, velvety and yet delicate texture so characteristic of the Blanc des Millenaires. Smooth and sensual, the wine reveals its generosity in notes of salty caramel and its mildness in a hint of almond milk, complemented by subtle notes of vanilla and cedar wood. A unique emotion, an impression of eternity, much like the feeling on has when standing in the heart of 2000-year old chalk cellars for which this wine is named. ",

Intensely perfumed, the complex nose immediately announces a powerful, structured, great ros\u00e9 wine. The Pinots Noirs, vinified as still red (8% of the blend) give the wine a particular aroma: that which comes from a simmering pot of bubbling strawberry jam, candied fruit mingled with mild spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, honey and pink praline. A true journey through flavor, the palate revels in the creamy sensation of juicy plums. This wine is characterized by a silky texture reminiscent of fig pie, pine nuts, and sweet pastries.

A rush of opulent weight, fruit notes of sweet peach, lemon curd toasted almond linger longer on the finish longer than one would expect in a wine whose vineyard is in its junior year.",
        "9937": "From its golden color to its opulent aromas of sweet pear, nectarine, spiced apple, lemon zest, pineapple, toasted coconut, hazelnuts, nutmeg and roasted grain, this is a flashy wine. It proves, as might be expected, extremely rich in the mouth, where flavors suggesting pear liqueur, apple tart and pineapple upside-down cake all make an appearance. The wines lavish texture is as evident in its very long finish, but bright fruit acidity curbs any tendency toward heaviness, keeping things in balance. ",

It has a delightful creaminess of texture, along with the zest to assure that it never seems heavy, as its cascade of ripe white peach, Fuji apple, pastry crust, bees wax, preserved lemon and toasted nut flavors washes through to a lingering finish.

A silky yet muscular contrast with sleek persistent flavors which are apparent immediately and with just the right amount of crispness at the finish without interfering with the creaminess. Airing shows it less powerful than its Sonoma Coast sibling but more vibrantly youthful, as it veers down a different path where everything turns graceful and feminine.",
        "9953": "Beautiful straw yellow, there is a sophisticated harmony to the aromas of this rich yet stylish bottling, as scents of honey suckle, nutmeg, toasted grains and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e continue to move through to the flavors on the palate.

When young, Carbonnieux's white wine charms with its freshness, its purity and its fruity, floral aromatic intensity. When mature, it develops notes of dried and preserved fruit which offer numerous opportunities for satisfying food matches.",

It is said that in the 18th century it was introduced to the Sultan of Constantinople's palace because of its clarity and was called \"mineral water from Carbonnieux\", thus defying the Islamic law. The clay\u2013limestone of Garonne gravel found in the Pessac-Leognan Appellation certainly produces the best dry white wines in the Bordeaux region. When young, Carbonnieux white wines are delightfully refreshing and pure with a fruity, floral intensity. When mature they develop hints of dried and candied fruits giving scope for a large range of gastronomic pairings. The batches which will form part of this \"cru classe\" will be blended so as to induce an excellent complicity between the grape varieties.

The wood is very discreet but brings  a little balsamic touch that well encapsulates the wine on its pastry sweetness. The palate, like his elder Chateau Cheval Blanc, beings quietly, almost shyly, then gradually accelerates to develop good volume, fat and smooth, to an elegant, fresh and distinguished final.

A small portion of the Roussanne will be aged in barrel but the rest will stay in tank on its fine lees. To preserve the freshness of the wine malolactic fermentation is prevented.",
        "18118": "The quality of this white really took off with the acquisition of a pneumatic press and cooling system in 2009--and the wine has never looked back. Traditionally, Marcoux's white is an unusual blend (in the sense that it was heavily Roussanne dominant) of 60% Roussanne and 40% Bourboulenc hailing from two parcels. The Roussanne's 0.5-hectares of vines in Les Esqueirons where the cool limestone-based soils are perfect for white grapes (bringing freshness, texture and finesse) and the Bourboulenc, a 0.35-hectare plot in Les Bosquets (this variety bringing more citric freshness and drive). From 2015, due to demand for this cuv\u00e9e, Sophie Armenier has been vinifying and blending in Marcoux's white varieties that grow on their 'red' vineyards--Grenache Blanc and Clairette. Pre-2015 these grapes were co-fermented with the estate Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Hence, the new blend looks something like this: Roussanne (55%; bringing the power), Bourboulenc (35%; freshness) and Grenache Blanc/Clairette (10%; flesh and finesse). The grapes are whole-berry pressed, naturally fermented and raised entirely in steel vat on fine lees. There is no b\u00e2tonnage and the malo is blocked to further underline the wine's structure and freshness. It's the kind of racy, juicy white that we wished the appellation made more of (and that we had more of!).",

        "23351": "A passion for a more austere Chablis style wine from this noble grape has been my goal for more than 36 years. The wine emphasizes and develops a minerality which, with age, develops into a very racy and elegant food worthy wine.",

With an ethereal aroma that alone is worth the price of a bottle, this fills the nostrils and imagination with myriad flowers, pit fruits, citrus, tropical fruits. Waxy rather than creamy in texture, and almost nobly rich in its honeyed way, with effusive ripe quince, banana and pink grapefruit tinged with salt and chalk, this cuvee finishes with purity, penetration, and remarkable persistence.\"",

It is porous and provides water to the vines in even the driest of summers. The average age of the vines is fifty years and they yield only 20 hectoliters per hectare. Harvesting done manually in several passes through the vineyard. Chidaine never chaptalizes wines that will finish with residual sugar.

Our 2014 Chardonnay is no exception. Make no mistake this wine is classically proportioned: completely dry with lovely acidity. Yet there is a depth to the wine that belies its relatively modest alcohol content. Eight months of sur lie aging contributes beautiful brioche, toasty aromas underscored by fresh white flower aromatics. ",

Fans of the recent vintages of Frog\u2019s Leap Chardonnay will not be disappointed with this effort: precise, crisp flavors, a mouthfeel without weight all with intriguing aromas of toasted hazelnuts, cream, and white peaches.

Carefully balanced on the acidic side, the 2016 Chardonnay has weight without heaviness, elegance without formality and drinkability without seeming to care. It is a food wine. Adept with a platter of oysters but more than willing to take on the richest, creamiest sauce. It should develop for many years to come.",

Although harvest began early, it extended into late October, with pristine fruit displaying wonderfully concentrated flavors balanced by crisp acidity.

A rich vanilla-honey scent gives an impression of sweetness to the overall aromatic profile. In the mouth, the inherent richness builds over time with classic Hanzell flavors of lemon, chamomile and clean mineral emanating from a tautly wound core structure which hints at what will develop with further aging.",
        "26252": "An elegant fragrance of chamomile, lemon and grapefruit pith, with darker tones of honey and bees wax followed by hazelnut and even savory elements of thyme and walnut. An even, mineral-dry, taut character to the wine when it first hits the tongue extends with a rounded fullness as it begins to develop in bottle.",
        "26254": "The attractive, high-toned aromas are of citrus blossoms, pear, green apple, vanilla, lemon oil, anise, clove, graphite, and clean mineral. A bit tightly wound initially, the mouth-watering acidity belies the full body and concentrated, sweet lemony fruit. As the wine opens up, the inherent richness and flavor intensity rise to demonstrate the quality and longevity of the vintage. The unfolding flavors are of ripe apple, citrus, clove and caramel on a long, mineral-laden finish.",
        "26271": "Grown, produced and bottled at the winery, Sebella Chardonnay allows us a way to work with and audition the Chardonnay fruit from our younger vineyards prior to their coming of age and inclusion in the Hanzell Chardonnay. Grown with the same exacting standards as all our vineyards, Sebella Chardonnay is a different interpretation of our fruit and site. With stainless steel fermentation and aging in more neutral oak (one to three year old barrels), Sebella Chardonnay has the signature of our vineyard's minerality with the freshness of young Chardonnay fruit aromas.",

The vineyard abuts an old redwood grove and faces cascading ridges to Bodega Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The well-known Coastlands Vineyard also borders the property. Because there is no ridge between the ocean and the vineyard, Seascape is in an extremely cold spot \u2013 so cold that Chardonnay is often picked in November. The vineyard is cropped to about two tons per acre to ensure thorough ripening. Although a challenging spot to farm, the reward at Seascape is Chardonnay grapes brimming with personality and a very distinctive terroir.",

On the palate the wine is clean and crisp, and harmoniously combines high natural acidity with rich fruit flavors, a mineral-like edge, and a touch of vanilla.

But there is a loophole, because an old, still officially accepted name in Austria for Sauvignon is \"Gruner Muskateller.\" The aromas of grapefruit, yellow plum, apricot, mint and black pepper simply soar from a glass of this wine, so hold on to your hat. The palate is perfectly judged in its balancing of an unusual degree of gloss and creaminess for a Sauvignon with vivacious acids, with the overall effect managing to be both enveloping and invigorating. This excellent value wine fills your mouth with flowers, resinous herbs, citrus and pit fruits, and the finish is at once gloriously juicy, endlessly refreshing, and positively sizzling with citrus zest, concentrated pit fruit and pungent herbal notes.\"",
        "26574": "Heidi's were unique Pinot Blancs, but 2000 announced a fundamental change in style.  They used to be correct enough, shellfishy, appley and leesy, but they sometimes tasted  as though a rogue gene snuck in carrying mimosa-blossom scents that took you to  another place entirely, not \"northern\" and vivid but rather cozier and more murmuring  and buttery. \"That was cask-aging,\" says Heidi. Lately she has been emphasizing batonnage and trying to get the wines more compact and dense. Pacific oysters in a glass! Plus the merest (and loveliest) hint of RS, and even a suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc in the finish. By the way, all of Heidi's whites in 2004 have a teensy bit of RS, which does them nothing but good. If I hadn't told you you wouldn't have known, but wondered why the wines were so gol-danged likeable; maize and corn notes, very racy and very ripe; less plump and more vertical then the `03, despite its high alc.

        "26637": "\"Floral notes of aidani dance on minerally assyrtiko, a surprisingly expressive and delicate Santorini from scent alone.

On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied, with bright pineapple-green apple acidity, and flavors of baked yellow apples and skins. ",
        "26654": "Peachy, forward fruit here. High, bright acid and clean, fruity, tangy flavors of lemon and nectarine that linger pleasantly on the palate. Great with a salad of shrimp and avocado, beets and red onions, gazpacho, or by itself as an ap\u00e9ritif.",
        "26664": "Due to its style and fine presence, this wine is a model of pure and delicate expression of the Sauvignon Blanc. In the style of a Grand Cru, La Demoiselle may age in bottle for 8 to 10 years. This is a wine to discover over time due to its intriguing evolution. In the first years, the fruit of the Sauvignon grape dominates with a discreet hint of terroir and small wood notes at the finish. With time, sensations become more homogenous, the terroir more expressive and the evolved Sauvignon shows us its complex aromatic palate. Finally, the light wood notes are completely melted away bringing enormous depth to this great wine.",
        "26667": "The delicate tropical fruit aromas (a proof of ripe Sauvignon grapes) and clean mineral and fruity palate testify to La Cote des Monts Damnes' pedigree as an exceptional wine from one of the finest slopes in the Sancerre appellation.

The word \"Mouches\" (Flies) was actually the local name for bees. As bee keepers started to set up their bee-hives, the area became known as \"Clos des Mouches\" (i.e. the Enclosure of the Honey Bees).",

        "29002": "Chablis is still a difficult region for the wine-maker. The climate is continental, hot in Summer and cold in Winter. Frosts are frequent. In spite of all these hardships, Robert DROUHIN is adamant to keep the yields in his vineyards as low as possible by pruning very short. At harvest time, the grapes are hand-picked and pressed at Joseph DROUHIN's own winery in Chablis. The next day, the must is brought to the cellars in Beaune and put in barrels for the alcoholic fermentation. After 8 to 9 months of ageing in oak, the wine is bottled. The wine Vaud\u00e9sir is one of the seven Grand Crus of Chablis and one of its largest, occupying a central position on the large hill overlooking the town of Chablis.

        "29016": "Chassagne-Montrachet always has a beautiful, limpid, golden hue. On the nose, there are often delicate nuances of pear, vanilla and almond flavors. Round and ample on the palate, the wine has length and complexity.",

Intense and elegant aromas come to the forefront: hawthorn, apricot notes, evolving towards hints of blond tobacco. As the wine ages, there are nuances of dried fruit and rare spices. A silky texture and a subtle touch of tannin give a true personality to the wine and a remarkable aftertaste. A great white Burgundy!",
        "29061": "A re ned wine, well appreciated in the whole world.

Long on the aftertaste, with  flavors of yellow plum and gingerbread.",

On the nose, a palette of interesting and varied aromas: syrup, grilled almond, preserved fruit. In the mouth, a silky and ample texture which does not exclude freshness or lightness. Long on the palate, with flavors recalling grilled bread and fruit jam. Always a consummate example of a white Burgundy, this wine is perfection!",
        "29064": "Meursault, as a wine village, goes back to Gallo-Roman times. The origin of the name Meursault itself is somewhat controversial. Some people believe it is derived from the Latin \"Muris Saltus\" translated as \"jump of a mouse\". More probably, it comes from an old Celtic root, \"mare\", meaning swamp : the lower part of the village is actually on very flat land. ",
        "29066": "This world-famous estate belongs to one of the oldest and most aristocratic French families : the Marquis de Laguiche. Out of the 14 different owners, the Marquis de Laguiche family is propri'taire of the largest portion of Le Montrachet, entirely located in Puligny (according to many authorities, the better side). It has been in their hands since 1363. It is ironical that the hillside of Montrachet, producing Burgundy's most prestigious white wine (and in some say the world's most complex), should look so unprepossessing. The etymology of the place-name is actually instructive : the word rachet refers to a poor type of soil where only scrawny bushes can grow. It is therefore on this \"poor, hard, infertile\" soil, which geologists call Bathonian limestone, that the Chardonnay grape develops this unique \"terroir\" character. Montrachet is full bodied and luscious, yet elegant. It is only after a few years in bottle that it will develop its famous complexity and richness. Nose and aftertaste are reminiscent of exotic fruit, honey, liquorice, grilled almond and many other flavours which wine lovers over the years have attempted to analyse. But it is perhaps a musical word which can best describe this glorious wine: a symphony of sensations.",
        "29077": "A wine for mere pleasure! Pale yellow color with numerous bright green reflections. Intense persistent flavors of peach and white flowers harmoniously meshed together.

        "29084": "Beautiful harmony defines this precious wine. Golden and bright color. The complex and distinctive aromas of Puligny are here in evidence: honey, honeysuckle, fresh almond. As the wine matures, these aromas evolve towards dried fruit notes and spice. On the palate, a very nice balance between freshness and velvety texture. There is even a firm backbone that gives this wine a strong structure. Exceptionally long on the aftertaste, with refined and floral notes throughout.",

        "29172": "Chardonnay grapes were harvested later than expected in 2006 but they arrived in immaculate condition. Though many local producers suffered botrytis infection due to cool, wet weather, Freestone suffered no such damage. The skins were crunchy and packed with flavor, while the berries were plump and juicy, boasting lots of natural acidity. This framework produced three very special groups of wine that make up our first Freestone Chardonnay blend.",
        "29173": "The 2007 Freestone Chardonnay has all the minerality and terroir characteristics that the 2006 Chardonnay possessed, but with an added weight and purity that expresses all that we are trying to achieve at Freestone. The long, dry growing season yielded smaller than typical clusters and grapes, so juice yields were lower than expected overall for the 2007 vintage, resulting in wines with great concentration and precision. Steely, yet unctuous, this wine generously offers up aromas of smoked cedar, wet earth, honeysuckle and fresh tangerine, while on the palate it provides mineral-driven citrus, nectar, honey, and an acid structure that contributes power and persistence.",
        "29175": "This wine is a mix of the best selections from the estate plantings, including some heirloom selections that define its character and structure. Initial aromas fill the senses with stone fruit and honeysuckle followed by citrus zest, wet stone, vanilla and toasted brioche. With a rich, creamy texture cut by crisp acidity, this Chardonnay has great intensity with vibrant, concentrated citrus, lemongrass, peach, honey and lemon cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e flavors. A full-bodied wine that is texturally complete with balanced minerality and a lingering finish.",
        "29176": "The 2011 Chardonnay is a mix of the best selections from the estate, including some heirloom selections that help to define the blend's character and structure. This Chardonnay opens with a bright bouquet overflowing with apple, honeysuckle, white flower and Meyer lemon zest laced with notes of crushed rock and toasted Brioche. Fresh and lively with balanced minerality and a creamy texture, the wine boasts tart green apple, lemon custard and honeydew melon flavors throughout. Long and lingering, the finish is touched with stone fruit and sweet vanilla.",
        "29177": "The 2012 Chardonnay opens with stone fruit, fragrant white flower, crushed rock and lemon zest aromas. Nicely balanced with a creamy texture and lush mouthfeel, the Meyer lemon cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, apricot and nutty toasted brioche flavors culminate in a long, opulent finish marked by sweet fruit and citrus.",
        "29178": "Fragrant orange blossom, citrus peel and ripe green apple scents are a hallmark of this wine.

        "29179": "Bursting with aromatic floral and citrus notes, the 2013 Chardonnay envelopes the senses with honeysuckle, ripe pear,lemon zest and sweet honey.

        "29261": "Ovation is our flagship Chardonnay - a blend of grapes displaying the highest aroma and flavor profiles from cool-climate vineyards that have been established using small-cluster clones of Chardonnay. Crop yields are low and flavors tend to be extraordinarily rich and concentrated.",

        "29271": "Absolutely delicious Sauvignon Blanc, with bright passion fruit and grapefruit flavors and aromas. One of the most consistently successful varietals at Phelps has been Sauvignon Blanc, planted in a warm pocket on the lower slopes of our ranch where it receives 12 hours of sunlight per day. These growing conditions promote exceptional ripening, and the result is a classic Sauvignon Blanc. Floral, spicy/fruity aromas; citrus (grapefruit) and melon-like flavors; a slight grassy component and excellent acidity all contribute to a crisp, lively-tasting wine that is especially compatible with seafood and poultry dishes.",
        "29276": "The 2015 Sauvignon Blanc showcases fragrant lime blossom, stone fruit and orange peel with tangy green apple, sumptuous lemon curd and juicy white peach.

Crisp and refreshing on the palate with balanced, racy acidity framing green apple, apricot and honeydew melon notes followed by a lemon curd and mineral finish.",
        "29280": "The Viognier crop weathered the temperature extremes well and produced a surprisingly impressive wine with concentrated peach-like aromas and honeysuckle flavors. The wine finishes with the typical soft balance, extra weight and added length that makes this variety so attractive.",
        "29282": "Nose of Meyer lemons, wet stones, and crushed oyster shell, There is also a bit of the classic bright pear and exotic tropical fruit that is the hallmark of this vineyard but it is framed by brilliant acidity. A great oyster and other shellfish wine. ",
        "29307": "The fruit for this Albari\u00f1o is sourced from the Cedar Lane Vineyard in Arroyo Seco. The vineyard resides on an alluvial bench surrounding the Arroyo Seco River and consists of granite and shaley loam soils. The soil composition, combined with great exposure to the winds that carry the marine influence from the Monterey bay down the Salinas Valley, creates wines with elevated aromatics and complex minerality.",
        "29318": "This wine is pale green-gold in color. Attractive aromas of pineapple and guava, combined with citrus and lemongrass overlay delicate nut and spice notes. Revealing the softer side of its Sauvignon Blanc heritage on the palate, this wine offers a delicious combination of mandarin and guava, beautifully laced with notes of brazil nut and honey from the wild ferment. The wine finishes with lingering lemon notes.",
        "29325": "This wine is pale lime in color. This Sauvignon Blanc is showing aromas of fruit salad, passion fruits and fleshed nectarines with underlying jalapeno peppers & vine ripened tomato stalks. The palate is surrounded by juicy acidity and tropical flavors of passion fruit, lychees and restrained herbaceous notes.  ",
        "29327": "Vibrant tropical and citrus aromas leap out of the glass, socking you with passionfruit pulp, mango, lemon and tahitian lime, backed up by fresh notes of lemon blossom and chamomile.

Juicy and dry, this wine has appetizing acidity and a beautiful lingering finish. ",
        "29332": "Grapefruit, salt, and wet rock, refreshing, rejuvenating and appetizing \u2013 all these attributes are found on the nose and the palate. Stone fruit completes the array of aromas. Definitely a terroir wine. The structure is compact and tightly woven while the style is cool and elegant and a fine texture coats the mouth. The Stein is playful and refreshing, yet is by no means superficial. ",
        "29379": "Aged for fifteen months before its release, the Cava displays a nice yellow color with some greenish and steely tinges. It also has a textbook aromatic expression of the Xarello grape and discreet notes of fennel, garrigue, rosemary and thyme along with touches of white fruit and dry fruit. On the other hand, the wine shows some bread-like, creamy notes coming from the yeasts. This Cava is fresh, gentle and creamy, with bitter notes of aromatic herbs, touches of dry fruit and a tense acidity. Nice little bubbles, long finish and a pleasant overall sensation.",
        "29382": "This cava seduces with its bright cherry red color and beautiful effervescence. It reflects the character of the variety, with its cherry and strawberry notes enveloped in honey, toasted bread and a faint floweriness. It is intense, fresh and exuberant in the mouth, with a rich, aromatic finish. ",
        "29385": "Pale gold in color, this Cava has aromas of mature white peach, toasted bread and green tea with hints of lemon citrus and apricots. Equally rich and broad on the palate, these flavors continue to unfold on the palate. ",
        "29388": "2014 had an early spring and a wonderful, long summer with cool nights to help maintain great acidity in the grapes. Going into the fall, temperatures cooled down quite a bit throughout the state, and we were able to hang the fruit for a longer period of time before harvest.

        "32479": "The bouquet shows fragrant and bright notes of lime blossom and cut lemon greet the nose, and are met with underlying hints of kaffir lime leaf and subtle spice. The palate is taut and focused offering lively lemon curd, lime pith and floral notes. Racy acidity defines the palate and provides great drive. These elements are woven together with a mineral finish.   ",
        "32480": "Freshly cut limes, lemon sorbet and hints of Granny Smith apples combine with pronounced floral notes, hints of sweet spice and fragrant kaffir lime leaf. The palate is taut and fine with bursting Tahitian lime and lemon pith. Lively and racy acid underpins the palate throughout. Mineral and flint characters make this vintage one of Leeuwin's finest.",
        "32497": "The color is a brilliant pale yellow with tints of green. The nose shows freshly cut yellow-fleshed peaches with some underlying subtle barrel fermentation characters. The palate is rich and full, though tightly structured, showing a combination of poached stone fruit and sweet grapefruit flavors. The wine will develop over the years and the flavors will meld into a soft, clearly varietal Margaret River chardonnay. Ideal to accompany fish and shellfish or any full flavored white meat.",
        "32499": "Color is transparent light straw with flashes of bright green. The initial aromas are intense and lifted with perfumes of white peach, nectarine/stone fruit backed by the wonderful pungency of citrus flowers. Although fermented in oak there is only an underpinning whisper of it present in the bouquet. The palate is up front with fruit showing a predominance of pears and citrus. It has weight, but with true elegance and softness. It finishes with a sense of depth and an aftertaste of nuttiness, tempered with fruit.",

        "32506": "A complex and layered palate and features a delicate lemon, pear and lime fruit spectrum at the forefront. Tight and focused, woven together by a pristine natural acid line. Mealy notes, gunflint and subtleties of nougat, fragrant jasmine and sweet spice provide breadth to an elegant nose. Delicately textured with vibrant grapefruit and freshly cut lime, width and complexity enhanced by fluffy nougat notes. A classical wine frm an outstanding vintage.",
        "32507": "Cut limes, ripe nashi pears and white peaches greet the nose, amidst aromas of fresh nougat, honeycomb, brioche and rice wafers. Savory lemon rind, figs and quince create complexity, while oak derived toasted hazelnuts and cinnamon spice is diligently incorporated to enhance the balance. The palate is tight and defined, characterized by fresh lime, white nectarine and pears. Luscious texture delivers balanced depth and breadth to the palate. Oatmeal, nutmeg and subtle oak char lie in the background, with all components brought together with a taut and refreshing acid line.",
        "32511": "The jasmine, frangipani, chamomile, and cardamom meet with the classical pear, lime, and lemon fruit spectrum in this fantastic wine. ",
        "32515": "A youthful straw green colour.",
        "32538": "In pursuit of balance and finesse in a warm growing season, Lemelson  did two picks on our Johnson Vineyard: the first, to preserve vibrancy and the second, for texture and aromatics. The result is a wine that expresses the fruit of the vintage while remaining fresh and lower in alcohol. Peach, Asian pear, honeysuckle and plum on the nose are accented by subtle notes of hazelnut, brioche and tarragon. The palate is energetic and fresh with citrus and spice at mid-palate leading way to a long, citrus and mineral finish. While many vintages of their Reserve Chardonnay have aged quite gracefully, the opulent fruit of this vintage suggests that this wine will be at its best over the next five years.  ",
        "32540": "The vineyard source for our Riesling remains constant as the style created in the vineyard and winery continues to evolve. Over the last four vintages, the Riesling has become drier and leaner, the 2009 has the least residual sugar yet. The nose shows lemon curd, pear, honeysuckle, chalk and lemongrass and develops honey and nectarine with time open. The palate is soft on entry with a vibrant mid-palate that turns to lime, nectarine ane mineral notes on the long finish.   ",
        "32564": "My favorite vintage of Saini Chenin Blanc to date, this wine has alluring weight and richness, a silky texture and dazzling aromas of Anjou pear, green apple, quince, lemon verbena and white flowers. With a lovely hint of viscosity to the mouthfeel, the flavors seem to glide across the palate, offering a medley of orchard fruit, Meyer lemon, and green pineapple notes, as well as hints of white tea and wet Riverstone minerality that carry through to a lingering finish.",
        "32654": "Brilliant golden yellow hue. Fruit (dried apricots, jam), spice and a hint of acacia flower honey on the nose. Complex palate with sweet, soft, mineral undertones. Long, fresh finish.",
        "32655": "Valle d'Aosta Chardonnay is a lovely yellow. The nose is delicately floral with hints of banana and a bit of plum. On the palate, the wine is soft, fruity and mineral. This Chardonnay from this region is grown with excellent results, giving a wine with exuberant fruit flavor, combined with a pure expression of the \"terroir\" of the mountain. ",
        "32668": null,
        "32679": "The nose combines spice with a reductive fruit; the palate displays peppery notes; a classic Veltliner from loess terraces. This wine is part of a line from Leth that displays complexity in flavor, minerality and durability.",

        "32720": "Like the Reserve Chardonnay, our Barcaglia Lane bottling receives four additional months of barrel aging on the lees resulting in broad texture and fine detail. It is sourced from a single rolling vineyard in the Russian River Valley, part of the famed Dutton Ranch. Planted for us in 1998, the site consists of 3 sloping blocks planted to three different clones. The wine is strikingly aromatic with ripened mandarin, blood orange and spiced apple fruits, shot through with honeysuckle and hazelnut spice. Voluptuously built with plenty of curves, the richly woven palate gives way to a lively citrus laced finish.",
        "32722": "2014 makes it three excellent vintages in a row for our Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay, sourced from a trio of clones at this Dutton Ranch vineyard. The wine is all succulent, ripe citrus with toasty tangerine, orange zest and lemon-lime. Toasty gun-barrel oak and vanilla, together with tropical fruit skin and spice completes the package. Buttressed by a framework of native acidity the wine is gauzy in weight and texture, staying up in the palate before finishing with focus and clarity.",
        "32723": "The nose alone takes our 2017 Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay to the highest level, with nectarine and vanilla chiffon, sterling rose and preserved lemon, mineral, and sweet oak spice. Deftly weighted with citrus and tree fruits the wine achieves balance through a ribbon of native acidity carrying on to a lengthy succulent finish.",
        "32742": "Crafted from a combination of Oak Knoll vines and longer-hanging Carneros clusters, our 2008 Napa Valley Chardonnay is satisfyingly ripe, yet focused and fresh in the same sip. Showy stone fruit, pear, hazelnut and toasty oak spices spill from the glass. Rich-bodied, fruitful and round on the palate with vanilla and subtle minerality, the wine is threaded with lively acidity bringing length and focus to a fine finish.",
        "32743": "Grapes for the 2015 Napa Chardonnay came in early and the wine centers around ripe Bosc pear and Fuji apple with delicious caramel custard, pie crust and hazelnut. Thickly textured and satiny smooth like Deux-Sevres butter, the richness and weight are buttressed with native acidity and subtle minerality bringing complexity and length to this delicious wine.",
        "32745": "Golden delicious apple, honeysuckle blossom and toasty caramel spice aromas are served up generously in the 2016 Napa Chardonnay. Silky in texture with ripe tree fruit and plenty of drive the wine is athletic and complex with a tail of smoky mineral and lees character.",
        "32765": "Neil Young's \"Cinnamon Girl\" best captures the character of our rocking 2015 Reserve Chardonnay. Ripe yet succulent D'Anjou pear, gardenia blossom, sweet mineral spice and toasty brioche aromas come singing through. Broad-shouldered, with creamy textured leesy flavors, the wine reaches great depth while maintaining precision and serious structure.",
        "32770": "Like a sailplane this 2018 Sauvignon Blanc soars with alluring floral spice, lemon-lime zest and hints of vanilla. A leading edge of native acidity frames a camber line of ripe mango and tropical fruit that tails gracefully with succulent lime skin and subtle mineral.",
        "32772": "Blazing tropical fruit, exotic spices and sexy ripe citrus come together in this tangerine dream. Like a beach volleyball Olympian, the wine has explosive power plus tremendous depth and range on the palate. Richness and precision are continually on point, and the wine sets up high in the mouth before stretching out in a tanned and impossibly long-legged, leesy finish. ",
        "32773": "Chardonnay is whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented and aged sur lies with batonnage in 100% French oak for 11-15 months, undergoing 100% malolactic fermentation, then bottled unfined and unfiltered. ",
        "32774": "Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."
