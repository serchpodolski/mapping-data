## Pandas And JSON Cleaning project

#### The following project addresses data cleaning using pandas and saving the result to a Json file.

We use the file "wine-ratings.csv" and process it to obtain only white wines with a rating between 90 and 92, and then save the results into a Json file calles "wine-ratings.json".
